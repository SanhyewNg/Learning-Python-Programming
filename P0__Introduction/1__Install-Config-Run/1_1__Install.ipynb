    "# 1.1. Installing the Python Interpreter\n",
    "\n",
    "Because you need the Python interpreter to run Python scripts, the first step in using Python is usually installing Python. Unless one is already available on your machine, you’ll need to fetch, install, and possibly configure a recent version of Python on your computer. You’ll only need to do this once per machine, and if you will be running a frozen binary (described in Chapter 2) or self-installing system, your setup tasks may be trivial or null."

    "## Is Python Already Present?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you do anything else, check whether you already have a recent Python on your machine. If you are working on Linux, Mac OS X, or some Unix systems, Python is probably already installed on your computer, though it may be one or two releases behind the cutting edge. Here’s how to check:\n",
    "\n",
    "- On **Windows 7** and earlier, check whether there is a Python entry in the Start button’s All Programs menu (at the bottom left of the screen). On Windows 8, look for Python in a Start screen tile, your Search tool, the “All apps” display on your Start screen, or a File Explorer in desktop mode (more on Windows 8 in an up coming sidebar).\n",
    "\n",
    "- On **Mac OS X**, open a Terminal window (Applications→Utilities→Terminal) and type python at the prompt. Python, IDLE, and its tkinter GUI toolkit are standard components of this system.\n",
    "\n",
    "- On **Linux** and **Unix**, type python at a shell prompt (a.k.a. terminal window), and see what happens. Alternatively, try searching for “python” in the usual places—`/usr/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, etc. As on Macs, Python is a standard part of Linux systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you find a Python, make sure it’s a recent version. Although any recent Python will do for most of this text, this edition focuses on Python 3.3 and 2.7 specifically, so you may want to install one of these to run some of the examples in this book.\n",
    "Speaking of versions, per the preface, I recommend starting out with Python 3.3 or later if you’re learning Python anew and don’t need to deal with existing 2.X code; otherwise, you should generally use Python 2.7. Some popular Python-based systems still use older releases, though (2.6 and even 2.5 are still widespread), so if you’re working with existing systems be sure to use a version relevant to your needs; the next section describes locations where you can fetch a variety of Python versions.\n"
