    "Python is a popular open source programming language used for both standalone programs and scripting applications in a wide variety of domains. It is free, portable, powerful, and is both relatively easy and remarkably fun to use. Programmers from every corner of the software industry have found Python’s focus on developer productivity and software quality to be a strategic advantage in projects both large and small.\n",

    "Python is probably the easiest-to-learn and nicest-to-use programming language in widespread use. Python code is clear to read and write, and it is concise without being cryptic. Python is a very expressive language, which means that we can usually write far fewer lines of Python code than would be required for an equivalent application written in, say, C++ or Java.\n",
    "Python is a cross-platform language: In general, the same Python program can be run on Windows and Unix-like systems such as Linux, BSD, and Mac OS X, simply by copying the ﬁle or ﬁles that make up the program to the target machine, with no “building” or compiling necessary. It is possible to create Python programs that use platform-speciﬁc functionality, but this is rarely necessary since almost all of Python’s standard library and most third-party libraries are fully and transparently cross-platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of Python’s great strengths is that it comes with a very complete standard library—this allows us to do such things as download a ﬁle from the Internet, unpack a compressed archive ﬁle, or create a web server, all with just one or a few lines of code. And in addition to the standard library, thousands of third-party libraries are available, some providing more powerful and sophisticated facilities than the standard library—for example, the Twisted networking library and the NumPy numeric library—while others provide functionality that is too specialized to be included in the standard library—for example, the SimPy simulation package. Most of the third-party librariesare available from the Python Package Index, pypi.python.org/pypi.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python can be used to program in procedural, object-oriented, and to a lesser extent, in functional style, although at heart Python is an object-oriented language. This book shows how to write both procedural and object-oriented programs, and also teaches Python’s functional programming features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this book is to show you how to write Python programs in good idiomatic Python 3 style, and to be a useful reference for the Python 3 language after the initial reading. Although Python 3 is an evolutionary rather than revolutionary advance on Python 2, some older practices are no longer appropriate or necessary in Python 3, and new practices have been introduced to take advantage of Python 3 features. Python 3 is a better language than Python 2—it builds on the many years of experience with Python 2 and adds lots of new features (and omits Python 2’s misfeatures),to make it even more of a pleasure to use than Python 2, as well as more convenient, easier, and more consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The book’s aim is to teach the Python language, and although many of the standard Python libraries are used, not all of them are. This is not a problem, because once you have read the book, you will have enough Python knowledge to be able to make use of any of the standard libraries, or any third-party Python library, and be able to create library modules of your own.\n",
