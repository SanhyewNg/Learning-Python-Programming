    "Somewhat more formally, in Python, data takes the form of objects—either built-in objects that Python provides, or objects we create using Python classes or external language tools such as C extension libraries. Although we’ll firm up this definition later, objects are essentially just pieces of memory, with values and sets of associated operations. As we’ll see, everything is an object in a Python script. Even simple numbers qualify, with values (e.g., `99`), and supported operations (addition, subtraction, and so on)."

    "## Python’s Core(Built-in) Object Types\n",
    "Python’s **built-in object types** are as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    " - Numbers \n",
    " - Strings \n",
    " - Lists \n",
    " - Tuples \n",
    " - Sets \n",
    " - Files \n",
    " - Other core types \n",
    " - Program unit types \n",
    " - Implementation-related types \n",
    "\n",
    "We usually call the other object types in the above list as **core data types**, though, because they are effectively built into the Python language—that is, there is specific expression syntax for generating most of them. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Program units*** such as *functions*, *modules*, and *classes*—which we’ll meet in later—are objects in Python too; they are created with *statements* and *expressions* such as `def`, `class`, `import`, and `lambda` and may be passed around scripts freely, stored within other objects, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python also provides a set of *implementation-related types* such as *compiled code* objects, which are generally of interest to tool builders more than application developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though, as we’ll see, there are no *type declarations* in Python, the syntax of the *expressions* you run determines the types of objects you create and use. Just as importantly, once you create an object, you bind its operation set for all time—you can perform only string operations on a string and list operations on a list. In formal terms, this means that Python is ***dynamically typed***, a model that keeps track of types for you automatically instead of requiring declaration code, but it is also ***strongly typed***, a constraint that means you can perform on an object only operations that are valid for its type.\n"

    "### Why Use Built-in Types?\n",
    "If you’ve used lower-level languages such as C or C++, you know that much of your work centers on implementing *objects*—also known as *data structures*—to represent the components in your application’s domain. You need to lay out memory structures, manage memory allocation, implement search and access routines, and so on. These chores are about as tedious (and error-prone) as they sound, and they usually distract from your program’s real goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "In typical Python programs, most of this grunt work goes away. Because Python provides powerful object types as an intrinsic part of the language, there’s usually no need to code object implementations before you start solving problems. In fact, unless you have a need for special processing that built-in types don’t provide, you’re almost always better off using a built-in object instead of implementing your own. Here are some reasons why:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Built-in objects make programs easy to write.** \n",
    "     For simple tasks, built-in types are often all you need to represent the structure of problem domains. Because you get powerful tools such as collections (lists) and search tables (dictionaries) for free, you can use them immediately. You can get a lot of work done with Python’s built-in object types alone.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Built-in objects are components of extensions.** \n",
    "     For more complex tasks, you may need to provide your own objects using Python classes or C language interfaces. But objects implemented manually are often built on top of built-in types such as lists and dictionaries. For instance, a stack data structure may be implemented as a class that manages or customizes a built-in list.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Built-in  objects  are  often  more  efficient  than  custom  data  structures.** \n",
    "     Python’s built-in types employ already optimized data structure algorithms that are implemented in C for speed. Although you can write similar object types on your own, you’ll usually be hard-pressed to get the level of performance built-in object types provide.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Built-in objects are a standard part of the language.** \n",
    "     In some ways, Python borrows both from languages that rely on built-in tools (e.g., LISP) and languages that rely on the programmer to provide tool implementations or frameworks of their own (e.g., C++). Although you can implement unique object types in Python, you don’t need to do so just to get started. Moreover, because Python’s built-ins are standard, they’re always the same; proprietary frameworks, on the other hand, tend to differ from site to site.\n",
    " \n",
    "In other words, not only do built-in object types make programming easier, but they’re also more powerful and efficient than most of what can be created from scratch. Regardless of whether you implement new object types, built-in objects form the core of every Python program.\n"

    "\n",
    "Every string operation is defined to produce a new string as its result, because strings are immutable in Python—they cannot be changed in place after they are created. In other words, you can never overwrite the values of immutable objects. For example, you can’t change a string by assigning to one of its positions, but you can always build a new one and assign it to the same name.

    "## Dynamic Typing \n",
    "In sum, variables are created when assigned, can *reference* any type of object, and must be assigned before they are referenced. This means that you never need to declare names used by your script, but you must initialize names before you can update them; counters, for example, must be initialized to zero before you can add to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ***dynamic typing*** model is strikingly different from the typing model of traditional languages. When you are first starting out, the model is usually easier to understand if you keep clear the distinction between names and objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, you don’t really need to draw name/object diagrams with circles and arrows to use Python. When you’re starting out, though, it sometimes helps you understand unusual cases if you can trace their reference structures as we’ve done here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, even if dynamic typing seems a little abstract at this point, you probably will care about it eventually. Because everything seems to work by assignment and references in Python, a basic understanding of this model is useful in many different contexts. It works the same in assignment statements, function arguments, for loop variables, module imports, class attributes, and more. The good news is that there is just one assignment model in Python; once you get a handle on dynamic typing, you’ll find that it works the same everywhere in the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the most practical level, dynamic typing means there is less code for you to write. Just as importantly, though, dynamic typing is also the root of Python’s *polymorphism*\n",

    "### “Weak” References\n",
    "You may occasionally see the term “weak reference” in the Python world. This is a somewhat advanced tool, but is related to the reference model we’ve explored here, and like the `is` operator, can’t really be understood without it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, a weak reference, implemented by the `weakref` standard library module, is a reference to an object that does not by itself prevent the referenced object from being garbage-collected. If the last remaining references to an object are weak references, the object is reclaimed and the weak references to it are automatically deleted (or otherwise notified).\n",
    "This can be useful in dictionary-based caches of large objects, for example; otherwise, the cache’s reference alone would keep the object in memory indefinitely. Still, this is really just a special-case extension to the reference model. For more details, see Python’s library manual.\n",
