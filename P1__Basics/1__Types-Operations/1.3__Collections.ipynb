    "### Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lists** are Python’s most flexible ordered collection object type. Unlike strings, lists can contain any sort of object: numbers, strings, and even other lists. Also, unlike strings, lists may be changed in place by assignment to offsets and slices, list method calls, deletion statements, and more—they are *mutable* objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python lists do the work of many of the collection data structures you might have to implement manually in lower-level languages such as C. Here is a quick look at their main properties. Python lists are:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Ordered collections of arbitrary objects**\n",
    "\n",
    "     From a functional view, lists are just places to collect other objects so you can treat them as groups. Lists also maintain a left-to-right positional ordering among the items they contain (i.e., they are sequences).\n",
    "     \n",
    " - **Accessed by offset**\n",
    "\n",
    "     Just as with strings, you can fetch a component object out of a list by indexing the list on the object’s offset. Because items in lists are ordered by their positions, you can also do tasks such as slicing and concatenation. \n",
    "\n",
    " - **Variable-length, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily nestable**\n",
    "\n",
    "     Unlike strings, lists can grow and shrink in place (their lengths can vary), and they can contain any sort of object, not just one-character strings (they’re heterogeneous). Because lists can contain other complex objects, they also support arbitrary nesting; you can create lists of lists of lists, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Of the category “mutable sequence”**\n",
    "\n",
    "     In terms of our type category qualifiers, lists are mutable (i.e., can be changed in place) and can respond to all the sequence operations used with strings, such as indexing, slicing, and concatenation. In fact, sequence operations work the same on lists as they do on strings; the only difference is that sequence operations such as concatenation and slicing return new lists instead of new strings when applied to lists. Because lists are mutable, however, they also support other operations that strings don’t, such as deletion and index assignment operations, which change the lists in place.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Arrays of object references**\n",
    "\n",
    "     Technically, Python lists contain zero or more references to other objects. Lists might remind you of arrays of pointers (addresses) if you have a background in some other languages. Fetching an item from a Python list is about as fast as indexing a C array; in fact, lists really are arrays inside the standard Python interpreter, not linked structures. Python always follows a reference to an object whenever the reference is used, so your program deals only with objects. Whenever you assign an object to a data structure component or variable name, Python always stores a reference to that same object, not a copy of it (unless you request a copy explicitly).\n"

    "### Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "The tuple object (pronounced “toople” or “tuhple,” depending on whom you ask) is roughly like a list that cannot be changed—tuples are sequences, like lists, but they are immutable,  like  strings.  Functionally,  they’re  used  to  represent  fixed  collections  of items: the components of a specific calendar date, for instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples construct simple groups of objects. They work exactly like lists, except that tuples can’t be changed in place (they’re immutable) and are usually written as a series of items in parentheses, not square brackets. Although they don’t support as many methods, tuples share most of their properties with lists. Here’s a quick look at the basics. Tuples are:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Ordered collections of arbitrary objects**\n",
    "\n",
    "     Like strings and lists, tuples are positionally ordered collections of objects (i.e., they maintain a left-to-right order among their contents); like lists, they can embed any kind of object.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Accessed by offset**\n",
    "     \n",
    "     Like strings and lists, items in a tuple are accessed by offset (not by key); they support all the offset-based access operations, such as indexing and slicing.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Of the category “immutable sequence”**\n",
    "     \n",
    "     Like strings and lists, tuples are sequences; they support many of the same operations. However, like strings, tuples are immutable; they don’t support any of the in-place change operations applied to lists.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Fixed-length, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily nestable**\n",
    "\n",
    "     Because tuples are immutable, you cannot change the size of a tuple without making a copy. On the other hand, tuples can hold any type of object, including other compound objects (e.g., lists, dictionaries, other tuples), and so support arbitrary nesting.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Arrays of object references**\n",
    "\n",
    "     Like lists, tuples are best thought of as object reference arrays; tuples store access points to other objects (references), and indexing a tuple is relatively quick.\n"

    "As a special case, Python also allows you to omit the opening and closing parentheses for a tuple in contexts where it isn’t syntactically ambiguous to do so. In the context of an assignment statement, Python recognizes this as a tuple, even though it doesn’t have parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes tuples must be enclosed in parentheses to avoid syntactic ambiguity. For example, to pass the tuple `1, 2, 3` to a function, we would write `function((1, 2, 3))`.\n",

    "The most common places where the parentheses are required for tuple literals are those where:\n",

    " - **Parentheses matter**—within a function call, or nested in a larger expression.\n",
    " - **Commas matter**—embedded in the literal of a larger data structure like a list or dictionary, or listed in a Python 2.X print statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most other contexts, the enclosing parentheses are optional. \n",
    "\n",
