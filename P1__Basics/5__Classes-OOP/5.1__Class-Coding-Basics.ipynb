    "reflecting real objects in a program’s domain. For instance, suppose we decide to implement that\n",
    "hypothetical pizza-making robot we used as an example in [Chapter 16](). If we implement\n",
    "it using classes, we can model more of its real-world structure and relationships. Two\n",
    "aspects of OOP prove useful here:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Inheritance*  \n",
    "  Pizza-making robots are kinds of robots, so they possess the usual robot-y properties. \n",
    "  In OOP terms, we say they “inherit” properties from the general category\n",
    "  of all robots. These common properties need to be implemented only once for the\n",
    "  general case and can be reused in part or in full by all types of robots we may build\n",
    "  in the future.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- *Composition*  \n",
    "  Pizza-making robots are really collections of components that work together as a \n",
    "  team. For instance, for our robot to be successful, it might need arms to roll dough,\n",
    "  motors to maneuver to the oven, and so on. In OOP parlance, our robot is an\n",
    "  example of composition; it contains other objects that it activates to do its bidding.\n",
    "  Each component might be coded as a class, which defines its own behavior and\n",
    "  relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "General OOP ideas like inheritance and composition apply to any application that can\n",
    "be decomposed into a set of objects. For example, in typical GUI systems, interfaces\n",
    "are written as collections of widgets—buttons, labels, and so on—which are all drawn\n",
    "when their container is drawn (*composition*). Moreover, we may be able to write our\n",
    "own custom widgets—buttons with unique fonts, labels with new color schemes, and\n",
    "the like—which are specialized versions of more general interface devices (*inheritance*).\n",
    "\n",
    "From a more concrete programming perspective, classes are Python program units, just\n",
    "like functions and modules: they are another compartment for packaging logic and\n",
    "data. In fact, classes also define new namespaces, much like modules. But, compared\n",

    "\n",
    "- *Multiple instances*  \n",
    "  Classes are essentially factories for generating one or more objects. Every time we\n",
    "  call a class, we generate a new object with a distinct namespace. Each object generated \n",
    "  from a class has access to the class’s attributes *and* gets a namespace of its\n",
    "  own for data that varies per object. This is similar to the per-call state retention of\n",
    "  [Chapter 17]()’s closure functions, but is explicit and natural in classes, and is just one\n",
    "  of the things that classes do. Classes offer a complete programming solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Customization via inheritance*  \n",
    "  Classes also support the OOP notion of inheritance; we can extend a class by \n",
    "  redefining its attributes outside the class itself in new software components coded\n",
    "  as subclasses. More generally, classes can build up namespace hierarchies, which\n",
    "  define names to be used by objects created from classes in the hierarchy. This\n",
    "  supports multiple customizable behaviors more directly than other tools.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- *Operator overloading*  \n",
    "  By providing special protocol methods, classes can define objects that respond to\n",
    "  the sorts of operations we saw at work on built-in types. For instance, objects made\n",
    "  with classes can be sliced, concatenated, indexed, and so on. Python provides\n",
    "  hooks that classes can use to intercept and implement any built-in type operation.\n",
    "\n",

    "first argument in functions (to receive the subject of a call) and inheritance attribute\n",
    "search (to support programming by customization). Other than this, the model is\n",
    "largely just functions that ultimately process built-in types. While not radically new,\n",
    "though, OOP adds an extra layer of structure that supports better programming than\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how the multiple objects idea works, you have to first understand that\n",
    "there are two kinds of objects in Python’s OOP model: *class* objects and *instance* objects. \n",
    " - Class objects provide default behavior and serve as factories for instance objects. Instance objects are the real objects your programs process—each is a namespace in its own right, but inherits (i.e., has automatic access to) names in the class from which it was created. \n",
    " - Class objects come from statements, and instances come from calls; each time you call a class, you get a new instance of that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "This object-generation concept is very different from most of the other program constructs \n",
    "we’ve seen so far. In effect, classes are essentially *factories* for generating multiple instances. By contrast, only one copy of each module is ever imported\n",
    "into a single program. In fact, this is why **reload** works as it does, updating a single-instance shared object in place. With classes, each instance can have its own, \n",
    "independent data, supporting multiple versions of the object that the class models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this role, class instances are similar to the per-call state of the *closure* (a.k.a. factory)\n",
    "functions of [:label:``], but this is a natural part of the class model, and state in classes\n",
    "is explicit attributes instead of implicit scope references. Moreover, this is just part of\n",
    "what classes do—they also support customization by inheritance, operator overloading, \n",
    "and multiple behaviors via methods. Generally speaking, classes are a more complete \n",
    "programming tool, though OOP and *functional programming* are not mutually exclusive paradigms. \n",
    "We may combine them by using functional tools in methods, by\n",
    "coding methods that are themselves generators, by writing user-defined iterators, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a quick summary of the bare essentials of Python OOP in terms of its\n",
    "two object types. As you’ll see, Python classes are in some ways similar to both `def`s\n",

This includes references to instances and classes made outside `class` statements (e.g., `X.attr`), as well as references to attributes of the `self` instance argument in a class’s method functions.

    "## Classes Can Intercept Python Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s move on to the third and final major difference between classes and modules:\n",
    "operator overloading. In simple terms, ***operator overloading*** lets objects coded with\n",
    "classes intercept and respond to operations that work on built-in types: addition, slicing, printing, qualification, and so on. It’s mostly just an automatic dispatch mechanism\n",
    "—expressions and other built-in operations route control to implementations in\n",
    "classes. Here, too, there is nothing similar in modules: modules can implement function\n",
    "calls, but not the behavior of expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we could implement all class behavior as method functions, operator overloading \n",
    "lets objects be more tightly integrated with Python’s object model. Moreover,\n",
    "because operator overloading makes our own objects act like built-ins, it tends to foster\n",
    "object interfaces that are more consistent and easier to learn, and it allows class-based\n",
    "objects to be processed by code written to expect a built-in type’s interface. Here is a\n",
    "quick rundown of the main ideas behind overloading operators:\n",
    "\n",
    "  + **Methods named with double underscores (*`__X__`*) are special hooks.**  \n",
    "    In Python classes, we implement operator overloading by providing specially named methods\n",
    "    to intercept operations. The Python language defines a fixed and unchangeable\n",
    "    mapping from each of these operations to a specially named method.\n",
    "\n",
    "  + **Such methods are called automatically when instances appear in built-in operations.**  \n",
    "    For instance, if an instance object inherits an `__add__` method, that\n",
    "    method is called whenever the object appears in a `+` expression. The method’s\n",
    "    return value becomes the result of the corresponding expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "  + **Classes may override most built-in type operations.**  \n",
    "    There are dozens of special operator overloading method names for intercepting and \n",
    "    implementing nearly every operation available for built-in types. This includes expressions, \n",
    "    but also basic operations like printing and object creation.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  + **There are no defaults for operator overloading methods, and none are required.**  \n",
    "    If a class does not define or inherit an operator overloading method, it just\n",
    "    means that the corresponding operation is not supported for the class’s instances.\n",
    "    If there is no `__add__`, for example, `+` expressions raise exceptions.\n",
    "    \n",
    "  + **New-style classes have some defaults, but not for common operations.**  \n",
    "    In Python 3.X, and so-called “new style” classes in 2.X that we’ll define later, \n",
    "    a root class named `object` does provide defaults for some *`__X__`* methods, but not for\n",
    "    many, and not for most commonly used operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "  + **Operators allow classes to integrate with Python’s object model.**  \n",
    "    By overloading type operations, the user-defined objects we implement with classes can\n",
    "    act just like built-ins, and so provide consistency as well as compatibility with\n",
    "    expected interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operator overloading is an optional feature; it’s used primarily by people developing\n",
    "tools for other Python programmers, not by application developers. And, candidly, you\n",
    "probably *shouldn’t* use it just because it seems clever or “cool.” Unless a class needs to\n",
    "mimic built-in type interfaces, it should usually stick to simpler named methods. Why\n",
    "would an employee database application support expressions like `*` and `+`, for example?\n",
    "Named methods like `giveRaise` and `promote` would usually make more sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this, we won’t go into details on every operator overloading method available\n",
    "in Python. Still, there is one operator overloading method you are likely\n",
    "to see in almost every realistic Python class: the `__init__` method, which is known as\n",
    "the ***constructor method*** and is used to initialize objects’ state. You should pay special\n",

    "Frankly, many operator overloading methods tend to be used only when you are implementing \n",
    "objects that are mathematical in nature; a vector or matrix class may overload \n",
    "the addition operator, for example, but an employee class likely would not. For\n",
    "simpler classes, you might not use overloading at all, and would rely instead on explicit\n",
    "method calls to implement your objects’ behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, you might decide to use operator overloading if you need to pass\n",
    "a user-defined object to a function that was coded to expect the operators available on\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answers\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Classes are always nested inside a module; they are attributes of a module object.\n",
    "Classes and modules are both namespaces, but classes correspond to statements\n",
    "(not entire files) and support the OOP notions of multiple instances, inheritance,\n",
    "and operator overloading (modules do not). In a sense, a module is like a single-instance \n",
    "class, without inheritance, which corresponds to an entire file of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Classes are made by running `class` statements; instances are created by calling a\n",
    "class as though it were a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Class attributes are created by assigning attributes to a class object. They are normally generated by top-level assignments nested in a `class` statement—each name\n",
    "assigned in the `class` statement block becomes an attribute of the class object\n",
    "(technically, the `class` statement’s local scope morphs into the class object’s attribute namespace, much like a module). Class attributes can also be created,\n",
    "though, by assigning attributes to the class anywhere a reference to the class object\n",
    "exists—even outside the `class` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Instance attributes are created by assigning attributes to an instance object. They\n",
    "are normally created within a class’s method functions coded inside the class\n",
    "statement, by assigning attributes to the `self` argument (which is always the implied instance). Again, though, they may be created by assignment anywhere a\n",
    "reference to the instance appears, even outside the `class` statement. Normally, all\n",
    "instance attributes are initialized in the ``__init__`` constructor method; that way,\n",
    "later method calls can assume the attributes already exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `self` is the name commonly given to the first (leftmost) argument in a class’s\n",
    "method function; Python automatically fills it in with the instance object that is\n",
    "the implied subject of the method call. This argument need not be called `self`\n",
    "(though this is a very strong convention); its position is what is significant. \n",
    "(Ex-C++ or Java programmers might prefer to call it this because in those languages\n",
    "that name reflects the same idea; in Python, though, this argument must always be\n",
    "explicit.)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Operator overloading is coded in a Python class with specially named methods;\n",
    "they all begin and end with double underscores to make them unique. These are\n",
    "not built-in or reserved names; Python just runs them automatically when an \n",
    "instance appears in the corresponding operation. Python itself defines the mappings\n",
    "from operations to special method names.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Operator overloading is useful to implement objects that resemble built-in types\n",
    "(e.g., sequences or numeric objects such as matrixes), and to mimic the built-in\n",
    "type interface expected by a piece of code. Mimicking built-in type interfaces enables \n",
    "you to pass in class instances that also have state information (i.e., attributes\n",
    "that remember data between operation calls). You shouldn’t use operator overloading \n",
    "when a simple named method will suffice, though.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. The `__init__` constructor method is the most commonly used; almost every class\n",
    "uses this method to set initial values for instance attributes and perform other\n",
    "startup tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. The special `self` argument in method functions and the `__init__` constructor\n",
    "method are the two cornerstones of OOP code in Python; if you get these, you\n",
    "should be able to read the text of most OOP Python code—apart from these, it’s\n",
    "largely just packages of functions. The inheritance search matters too, of course,\n",
    "but `self` represents the automatic object argument, and `__init__` is widespread."
