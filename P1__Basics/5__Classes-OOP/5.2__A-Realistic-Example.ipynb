    "the same roles as *records* and *programs* in more traditional terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, in this section we’re going to code two classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "  + `Person`—a class that creates and processes information about \n",
    "  \n",
    "  + `Manager`—a customization of `Person` that modifies inherited behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way, we’ll make instances of both classes and test out their functionality.\n",
    "When we’re done, I’ll show you a nice example use case for classes—we’ll store our\n",
    "instances in a *shelve* object-oriented database, to make them permanent. That way, you\n",

    "class syntax on paper, but have trouble seeing how to get started when confronted\n",
    "with having to code a new class from scratch. Toward this end, we’ll take it one step\n",
    "at a time here, to help you learn the basics; we’ll build up the classes gradually, so you\n",
    "can see how their features come together in complete programs.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What we really want to do here is somehow *augment* the original `giveRaise`, instead of\n",

    "`self` yourself; for code inside a method like `giveRaise`, `self` already is the subject of the\n",
    "call, and hence the instance to pass along.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "  + Second, and perhaps more importantly, the current display format shows *only* the\n",

    "  For example, we can’t yet verify that `tom`’s job name has been set to `mgr` correctly\n",

    "  `__repr__` for new names to be displayed, or it will become out of sync over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last point means that, yet again, we’ve made potential extra work for ourselves in\n",

    "One last subtlety here: because our `AttrDisplay` class in the `classtools` module is a\n",
    "general tool designed to be mixed into other arbitrary classes, we have to be aware of\n",
    "the potential for unintended *name collisions* with client classes. As is, I’ve assumed that\n",
    "client subclasses may want to use both its `__repr__` and `gatherAttrs`, but the latter of\n",
    "these may be more than a subclass expects—if a subclass innocently defines a `gatherAttrs` \n",
    "name of its own, it will likely break our class, because the lower version in the\n",
    "subclass will be used instead of ours.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see this for yourself, add a `gatherAttrs` to `TopTest` in the file’s self-test code; unless\n",
    "the new method is identical, or intentionally customizes the original, our tool class will\n",
    "no longer work as planned—`self.gatherAttrs` within `AttrDisplay` searches anew from\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answers\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the final version of our classes, `Manager` ultimately inherits its `__repr__` printing\n",
    "method from `AttrDisplay` in the separate `classtools` module and two levels up in\n",
    "the class tree. `Manager` doesn’t have one itself, so the inheritance search climbs to\n",
    "its `Person` superclass; because there is no `__repr__` there either, the search climbs\n",
    "higher and finds it in `AttrDisplay`. The class names listed in parentheses in a\n",
    "`class` statement’s header line provide the links to higher superclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Shelves (really, the `pickle` module they use) automatically relink an instance to the\n",
    "class it was created from when that instance is later loaded back into memory.\n",
    "Python reimports the class from its module internally, creates an instance with its\n",
    "stored attributes, and sets the instance’s `__class__` link to point to its original class.\n",
    "This way, loaded instances automatically obtain all their original methods (like\n",
    "lastName, giveRaise, and `__repr__`), even if we have not imported the instance’s\n",
    "class into our scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. It’s important to move processing into methods so that there is only one copy to\n",
    "change in the future, and so that the methods can be run on any instance. This is\n",
    "Python’s notion of *encapsulation*—wrapping up logic behind interfaces, to better\n",
    "support future code maintenance. If you don’t do so, you create code redundancy\n",
    "that can multiply your work effort as the code evolves in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Customizing with subclasses reduces development effort. In OOP, we code by\n",
    "*customizing* what has already been done, rather than copying or changing existing\n",
    "code. This is the real “big idea” in OOP—because we can easily extend our prior\n",
    "work by coding new subclasses, we can leverage what we’ve already done. This is\n",
    "much better than either starting from scratch each time, or introducing multiple\n",
    "redundant copies of code that may all have to be updated in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Copying and modifying code *doubles* your potential work effort in the future, \n",
    "regardless of the context. If a subclass needs to perform default actions coded in a\n",
    "superclass method, it’s much better to call back to the original through the superclass’s \n",
    "name than to copy its code. This also holds true for superclass constructors.\n",
    "Again, copying code creates redundancy, which is a major issue as code evolves.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Generic tools can avoid hardcoded solutions that must be kept in sync with the\n",
    "rest of the class as it evolves over time. A generic `__repr__` print method, for \n",
    "example, need not be updated each time a new attribute is added to instances in an\n",
    "`__init__` constructor. In addition, a generic print method inherited by all classes\n",
    "appears and need be modified in only one place—changes in the generic version\n",
    "are picked up by all classes that inherit from the generic class. Again, eliminating\n",
    "code *redundancy* cuts future development effort; that’s one of the primary assets\n",
    "classes bring to the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Inheritance is best at coding extensions based on direct customization (like our\n",
    "`Manager` specialization of `Person`). Composition is well suited to scenarios where\n",
    "multiple objects are aggregated into a whole and directed by a controller layer class.\n",
    "Inheritance passes calls *up* to reuse, and composition passes *down* to delegate.\n",
    "Inheritance and composition are not mutually exclusive; often, the objects embedded \n",
    "in a controller are themselves customizations based upon inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Not much since this was really a first-cut prototype, but the `lastName` method\n",
    "would need to be updated for the new name format; the `Person` constructor would\n",
    "have change the job default to an empty list; and the `Manager` class would probably\n",
    "need to pass along a job list in its constructor instead of a single string (self-test\n",
    "code would change as well, of course). The good news is that these changes would\n",
    "need to be made in just one place—in our classes, where such details are encapsulated. \n",
    "The database scripts should work as is, as shelves support arbitrarily nested data.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. The classes in this chapter could be used as boilerplate “template” code to \n",
    "implement a variety of types of databases. Essentially, you can repurpose them by \n",
    "modifying the constructors to record different attributes and providing whatever \n",
    "methods are appropriate for the target application. For instance, you might use \n",
    "attributes such as `name`, `address`, `birthday`, `phone`, `email`, and so on for a contacts\n",
    "database, and methods appropriate for this purpose. A method named `sendmail`,\n",
    "for example, might use Python’s standard library `smptlib` module to send an email\n",
    "to one of the contacts automatically when called (see Python’s manuals or application-level books for more details on such tools). The `AttrDisplay` tool we wrote\n",
    "here could be used verbatim to print your objects, because it is intentionally\n",
    "generic. Most of the shelve database code here can be used to store your objects,\n",
    "too, with minor changes."
