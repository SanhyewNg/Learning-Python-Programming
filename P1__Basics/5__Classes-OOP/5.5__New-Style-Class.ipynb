    "## The “New Style” Class Model\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In release 2.2, Python introduced a new flavor of classes, known as *new-style* classes;\n",
    "classes following the original and traditional model became known as *classic* classes\n",
    "when compared to the new kind. In 3.X the class story has merged, but it remains split\n",
    "for Python 2.X users and code:\n",
    "\n",
    "  + In *Python 3.X*, all classes are automatically what were formerly called “new style,”\n",
    "    whether they explicitly inherit from `object` or not. Coding the `object` superclass is\n",
    "    optional and implied.\n",
    "\n",
    "  + In *Python 2.X*, classes must explicitly inherit from `object` (or another built-in type)\n",
    "    to be considered “new style” and enable and obtain all new-style behavior. Classes\n",
    "    without this are “classic.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Because all classes are automatically new-style in 3.X, the features of new-style classes\n",
    "are simply normal class features in that line. I’ve opted to keep their descriptions in this\n",
    "section separate, however, in deference to users of Python 2.X code—classes in such\n",
    "code acquire new-style features and behavior only when they are derived from `object`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, when Python 3.X users see descriptions of “new style” topics in this\n",
    "book, they should take them to be descriptions of existing properties of their classes.\n",
    "For 2.X readers, these are a set of optional changes and extensions that you may choose\n",
    "to enable or not, unless the code you must use already employs them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python 2.X, the identifying *syntactic* difference for new-style classes is that they are\n",
    "derived from either a built-in type, such as `list`, or a special built-in class known as\n",
    "`object`. The built-in name `object` is provided to serve as a superclass for new-style\n",
    "classes if no other built-in type is appropriate to use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    class newstyle(object):                 # 2.X explicit new-style derivation\n",
    "    ...normal class code...                 # Not required in 3.X: automatic\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "new-style class. That is, as long as a built-in type is somewhere in its superclass tree, a\n",

    "(and is often as complex as) other languages in this domain.\n",

    "of *type* around the time of Python 2.2, though they went unnoticed by many until they\n",
    "were escalated to required knowledge in 3.X. You’ll need to judge the success of that\n",
    "merging for yourself, but as we’ll see, there are still distinctions in the model—now\n",
    "between *class* and *metaclass*—and one of its side effects is to make normal classes more\n",
    "powerful but also substantially more complex. The new-style inheritance algorithm\n",
    "formalized in [Chapter 40](), for example, grows in complexity by at least a factor of 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, some programmers using straightforward application code may notice only slight\n",

    "point in this book writing substantial class examples, with mostly just passing mentions\n",
    "of this change. Moreover, the classic class model still available in 2.X works exactly as\n",
    "it has for some two decades.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, because they modify core class behaviors, new-style classes had to be introduced \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "New-style classes differ from classic classes in a number of ways, some of which are\n",
    "subtle but can impact both existing 2.X code and common coding styles. As preview\n",
    "and summary, here are some of the most prominent ways they differ:\n",
    "\n",
    "  + *Attribute fetch for built-ins: instance skipped*  \n",
    "    The `__getattr__` and `__getattribute__` generic attribute interception methods are\n",
    "    still run for attributes accessed by explicit name, but no longer for attributes \n",
    "    implicitly fetched by built-in operations. They are not called for `__X__` operator \n",
    "    overloading method names in built-in contexts only—the search for such names begins\n",
    "    at classes, not instances. This breaks or complicates objects that serve as *proxies*\n",
    "    for another object’s interface, if wrapped objects implement operator overloading.\n",
    "    Such methods must be redefined for the sake of differing built-ins dispatch in \n",
    "    new-style classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "  + *Classes and types merged: type testing*  \n",
    "    Classes are now types, and types are now classes. In fact, the two are essentially\n",
    "    synonyms, though the *metaclasses* that now subsume types are still somewhat distinct \n",
    "    from normal classes. The `type(I)` built-in returns the class an instance is made\n",
    "    from, instead of a generic instance type, and is normally the same as `I.__class__`.\n",
    "    Moreover, classes are instances of the `type` class, and `type` may be subclassed to\n",
    "    customize class creation with metaclasses coded with `class` statements. This can\n",
    "    impact code that tests types or otherwise relies on the prior type model.\n",
    "\n",
    "  + *Automatic object root class: defaults*  \n",
    "    All new-style classes (and hence types) inherit from `object`, which comes with a\n",
    "    small set of default operator overloading methods (e.g., `__repr__`). In 3.X, this class\n",
    "    is added automatically above the user-defined root (i.e., *topmost*) classes in a tree,\n",
    "    and need not be listed as a superclass explicitly. This can affect code that assumes\n",
    "    the absence of method defaults and root classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "  + *Inheritance search order: MRO and diamonds*  \n",
    "    Diamond patterns of multiple inheritance have a slightly different search order—\n",
    "    roughly, at diamonds they are searched across before up, and more breadth-first\n",
    "    than depth-first. This attribute search order, known as the MRO, can be traced\n",
    "    with a new `__mro__` attribute available on new-style classes. The new search order\n",
    "    largely applies only to diamond class trees, though the new model’s implied\n",
    "    object root itself forms a diamond in all multiple inheritance trees. Code that relies\n",
    "    on the prior order will not work the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "  + *Inheritance algorithm: [Chapter 40]()*  \n",
    "    The algorithm used for inheritance in new-style classes is substantially more complex \n",
    "    than the depth-first model of classic classes, incorporating special cases for\n",
    "    descriptors, metaclasses, and built-ins. We won’t be able to formalize this until\n",
    "    [Chapter 40]() after we’ve studied metaclasses and descriptors in more depth, but it\n",
    "    can impact code that does not anticipate its extra convolutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "  + *New advanced tools: code impacts*  \n",
    "    New-style classes have a set of new class tools, including *slots*, *properties*, *descriptors*, `super`, and the `__getattribute__` method. Most of these have very specific\n",
    "    tool-building purposes. Their use can also impact or break existing code, though;\n",
    "    slots, for example, sometimes prevent creation of an instance namespace dictionary\n",
    "    altogether, and generic attribute handlers may require different coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll explore the *extensions* noted in the last of these items in a later top-level section\n",
    "of its own, and will defer formal inheritance algorithm coverage until [Chapter 40]() as\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We introduced this new-style class change in sidebars in both [Chapter 28]() and [Chapter 31]() \n",
    "because of their impact on prior examples and topics. In new-style classes (and\n",
    "hence all classes in 3.X), the generic instance attribute interception methods \n",
    "`__getattr__` and `__getattribute__` are no longer called by built-in operations for `__X__` \n",

    "You can find formal rationales for this change elsewhere; this book is disinclined to\n",
    "parrot justifications for a change that breaks many working programs. But this is \n",
    "imagined as both an *optimization* path and a solution to a seemingly obscure *call pattern* \n",
    "issue. The former rationale is supported by the frequency of built-in operations. If\n",
    "every `+`, for example, requires extra steps at the instance, it can degrade program speed\n",
    "—especially so given the new-style model’s many attribute-level extensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The latter rationale is more obscure, and is described in Python manuals; in short, it\n",
    "reflects a conundrum introduced by the *metaclass* model. Because classes are now \n",
    "instances of metaclasses, and because metaclasses can define built-in operator methods\n",
    "to process the classes they generate, a method call run for a class must skip the class\n",
    "itself and look one level higher to pick up a method that processes the class, rather than\n",
    "selecting the class’s own version. Its own version would result in an unbound method\n",
    "call, because the class’s own method processes lower instances. This is just the usual\n",
    "unbound method model we discussed in the prior section, but is potentially aggravated\n",
    "by the fact that classes can acquire type behavior from metaclasses too.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, because classes are both types and instances in their own right, all instances\n",
    "are skipped for built-in operation method lookup. This is supposedly applied to normal\n",
    "instances for uniformity and consistency, but both non-built-in names and direct and\n",
    "explicit calls to built-in names still check the instance anyhow. Though perhaps a \n",

    "one it broke. Its role as optimization path seems more defensible, but also not without\n",
    "repercussions.\n",

    "In particular, this has potentially broad implications for the *delegation*-based classes,\n",
    "often known as ***proxy classes***, when embedded objects implement operator overloading. \n",
