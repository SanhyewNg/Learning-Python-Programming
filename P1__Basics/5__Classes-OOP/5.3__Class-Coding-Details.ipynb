    "on the surface, on closer inspection, it is quite different from what some programmers\n",
    "are used to. For example, as in C++, the `class` statement is Python’s main OOP tool,\n",

    "and stores a reference to it in the name used in the header. Also like a `def`, a `class`\n",
    "statement is true executable code—your class doesn’t exist until Python reaches and\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`class` is a compound statement, with a body of statements typically indented appearing\n",
    "under the header. In the header, superclasses are listed in parentheses after the class\n",
    "name, separated by commas. Listing more than one superclass leads to multiple inheritance. \n",
    "Here is the statement’s general form:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    class name(superclass,...):         # Assign to name\n",
    "        attr = value                    # Shared class data\n",

    "            self. attr = value          # Per-instance data\n",
    "```\n",

    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "As we’ve seen, classes are mostly just *namespaces*—that is, tools for defining names\n",
    "(i.e., attributes) that export data and logic to clients. A `class` statement effectively \n",
    "defines a namespace. The statements nested in a `class` statement body create its attributes. \n",
    "When Python executes a `class` statement (not a call to a class), it runs all the statements \n",
    "in its body, from top to bottom. Assignments that\n",
    "happen during this process create names in the class’s local scope, which become \n",
    "attributes in the associated class object. Because of this, classes resemble both *modules*\n",
    "and *functions*:\n",
    "\n",
    "  + Like functions, `class` statements are local scopes where names created by nested assignments live.\n",
    "\n",
    "  + Like names in a module, names assigned in a `class` statement become attributes in a class object.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main distinction for classes is that their namespaces are also the basis of *inheritance* \n",
    "in Python; reference attributes that are not found in a class or instance object are\n",
    "fetched from other classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because `class` is a compound statement, any sort of statement can be nested inside its\n",
    "body—`print`, assignments, `if`, `def`, and so on. All the statements inside the `class` statement run when the `class` statement itself runs (not when the class is later called to make\n",
    "an instance). Typically, assignment statements inside the `class` statement make ***data attributes***, and nested `def`s make ***method attributes***. In general, though, any type of\n",
    "name assignment at the top level of a `class` statement creates a same-named attribute\n",
    "of the resulting class object.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, assignments of simple nonfunction objects to class attributes produce\n",

    "   the `action` method is located in the `Provider` subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "This “filling in the blanks” sort of coding structure is typical of OOP frameworks. In a\n",

    "provide data to be rendered as part of a web page, process a tag’s text in an XML file,\n",
    "and so on—your subclass provides specific actions, but the framework handles the rest\n",

    "pattern in some types of programs, with scope implications that follow naturally from\n",
    "what you already know, but that may not be obvious on first encounter. This section\n",
    "illustrates the concept by example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though they are normally coded at the top level of a module, classes also sometimes\n",
    "appear nested in functions that generate them—a variation on the “factory function”\n",
    "(a.k.a. *closure*) theme in [Chapter 17](), with similar state retention roles. There we noted\n",

    "\n",
    "This rule applies both to the top level of the class itself, as well as to the top level of\n",

    "2. What happens when a simple assignment statement appears at the top level of a\n",

    "6. What...was the capital of Assyria?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answers\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An abstract superclass is a class that calls a method, but does not inherit or define\n",
    "    it—it expects the method to be filled in by a subclass. This is often used as a way\n",
    "    to generalize classes when behavior cannot be predicted until a more specific \n",
    "    subclass is coded. OOP frameworks also use this as a way to dispatch to client-defined,\n",
    "    customizable operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When a simple assignment statement (`X = Y`) appears at the top level of a `class`\n",
    "    statement, it attaches a data attribute to the class (*`Class.X`*). Like all class attributes,\n",
    "    this will be shared by all instances; data attributes are not callable method functions, though.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A class must manually call the `__init__` method in a superclass if it defines an\n",
    "    `__init__` constructor of its own and still wants the superclass’s construction code\n",
    "    to run. Python itself automatically runs just *one* constructor—the lowest one in\n",
    "    the tree. Superclass constructors are usually called through the class name, passing\n",
    "    in the `self` instance manually: `Superclass.__init__(self, ...)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. To augment instead of completely replacing an inherited method, redefine it in a\n",
    "    subclass, but call back to the superclass’s version of the method manually from the\n",
    "    new version of the method in the subclass. That is, pass the `self` instance to the\n",
    "    superclass’s version of the method manually: `Superclass. method(self, ...)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. A class is a local scope and has access to enclosing local scopes, but it does not\n",
    "    serve as an enclosing local scope to further nested code. Like modules, the class\n",
    "    local scope morphs into an attribute namespace after the `class` statement is run.\n",

    "    Khorsabad), and finally Nineveh."
