    "## Why Use Modules?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, modules provide an easy way to organize components into a system by serving\n",
    "as self-contained packages of variables known as *namespaces*. All the names defined at\n",
    "the top level of a module file become attributes of the imported module object. As we\n",
    "saw in the last chapter of this book, imports give access to names in a module’s global\n",
    "scope. That is, the module file’s global scope *morphs* into the module object’s attribute\n",
    "namespace when it is imported. Ultimately, Python’s modules allow us to link individual \n",
    "files into a larger program system.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, modules have at least three roles:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Code reuse*  \n",
    "    Modules let you save code in files permanently. Unlike\n",
    "    code you type at the Python interactive prompt, which goes away when you exit\n",
    "    Python, code in module files is *persistent*—it can be reloaded and rerun as many\n",
    "    times as needed. Just as importantly, modules are a place to define names, known\n",
    "    as *attributes*, which may be referenced by multiple external clients. When used\n",
    "    well, this supports a *modular* program design that groups functionality into reusable \n",
    "    units.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *System namespace partitioning*  \n",
    "    Modules are also the highest-level program organization unit in Python. Although\n",
    "    they are fundamentally just packages of names, these packages are also *self-contained*—\n",
    "    you can never see a name in another file, unless you explicitly import that\n",
    "    file. Much like the local scopes of functions, this helps avoid name clashes across\n",
    "    your programs. In fact, you can’t avoid this feature—everything “lives” in a module, \n",
    "    both the code you run and the objects you create are always implicitly enclosed\n",
    "    in modules. Because of that, modules are natural tools for grouping system components.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Implementing shared services or data*  \n",
    "    From an operational perspective, modules are also useful for implementing components \n",
    "    that are shared across a system and hence require only a *single copy*. For\n",
    "    instance, if you need to provide a global object that’s used by more than one function \n",
    "    or file, you can code it in a module that can then be imported by many clients.\n",

    "### How to Structure a Program\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "At a base level, a Python program consists of text files containing Python *statements*,\n",
    "with one main *top-level* file, and zero or more supplemental files known as *modules*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how this works. The top-level (a.k.a. script) file contains the main flow of control\n",
    "of your program—this is the file you run to launch your application. The module files\n",
    "are libraries of tools used to collect components used by the top-level file, and possibly\n",
    "elsewhere. Top-level files use tools defined in module files, and modules use tools \n",
    "defined in other modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although they are files of code too, module files generally don’t do anything when run\n",
    "directly; rather, they define tools intended for use in other files. A file *imports* a module\n",
    "to gain access to the tools it defines, which are known as its *attributes*—variable names\n",
    "attached to objects such as functions. Ultimately, we import modules and access their\n",

    "top-level file; it will be a simple text file of statements, which is executed from top to\n",
    "bottom when launched. The files `b.py` and `c.py` are modules; they are simple text files\n",

Python’s standard library provides a collection of precoded modules.](../../imgs/program-architecture.jpg)\n",
    "[:label:`program-architecture`]()\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, suppose the file `b.py` in [:numref:`program-architecture`]() defines a function called `spam`, for\n",
    "external use. As we learned when studying functions in [Part IV](), `b.py` will contain a\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    def spam(text):                 # File b.py\n",
    "        print(text, 'spam')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, suppose `a.py` wants to use `spam`. To this end, it might contain Python statements\n",
    "such as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    import b                        # File a.py\n",
    "    b.spam('gumby')                 # Prints \"gumby spam\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first of these, a Python `import` statement, gives the file `a.py` access to everything\n",
    "defined by top-level code in the file `b.py`. The code import `b` roughly means:\n",
    "\n",
    "Load the file `b.py` (unless it’s already loaded), and give me access to all its attributes\n",
    "through the name `b`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To satisfy such goals, `import` (and, as you’ll see later, `from`) statements execute and load\n",
    "other files on request. More formally, in Python, cross-file module linking is not resolved \n",
    "until such `import` statements are executed at *runtime*; their net effect is to assign\n",
    "module names—simple variables like `b`—to loaded module objects. In fact, the module\n",
    "name used in an `import` statement serves two purposes: it identifies the external *file* to\n",
    "be loaded, but it also becomes a *variable* assigned to the loaded module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, objects *defined* by a module are also created at runtime, as the `import` is\n",
    "executing: `import` literally runs statements in the target file one at a time to create its\n",
    "contents. Along the way, every name assigned at the top-level of the file becomes an\n",
    "attribute of the module, accessible to importers. For example, the second of the statements in `a.py` calls the function `spam` defined in the module `b`—created by running its\n",

    "(`'gumby'`). If you actually type these files, save them, and run `a.py`, the words “gumby\n",
    "spam” will be printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we’ve seen, the `object.attribute` notation appears throughout Python code—most\n",
    "objects have useful attributes that are fetched with the “.” operator. Some reference\n",
    "callable objects like functions that take action (e.g., a salary computer), and others are\n",
    "simple data values that denote more static objects and properties (e.g., a person’s\n",
    "name).\n",
    "\n",
    "The notion of importing is also completely general throughout Python. Any file can\n",
    "import tools from any other file. For instance, the file `a.py` may import `b.py` to call its\n",
    "function, but `b.py` might also import `c.py` to leverage different tools defined there. \n",
    "Import chains can go as deep as you like: in this example, the module `a` can import `b`,\n",
    "which can import `c`, which can import `b` again, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides serving as the highest organizational structure, modules (and module packages,\n",
    "described in [Chapter 24]()) are also the highest level of *code reuse* in Python. Coding\n",
    "components in module files makes them useful in your original program, and in any\n",
    "other programs you may write later. For instance, if after coding the program in [:numref:`program-architecture`]() we discover that the function `b.spam` is a general-purpose tool, we can reuse\n",
